In 1951 David A. Huffman and his classmates in an electrical engineering
graduate course on information theory were given the choice of a term paper
or a final exam. For the term paper, Huffman's professor, Robert M. Fano,
had assigned what at first appeared to be a simple problem. Students were
asked to find the most efficient method of representing numbers, letters or
other symbols using a binary code. Besides being a nimble intellectual exercise,
finding such a code would enable information to be compressed for
transmission over a computer network or for storage in a computer's memory.
Huffman worked on the problem for months, developing a number of approaches,
but none that he could prove to be the most efficient. Finally, he
despaired of ever reaching a solution and decided to start studying for the
final. Just as he was throwing his notes in the garbage, the solution came to
him. "It was the most singular moment of my life," Huffman says. "There
was the absolute lightning of sudden realization."
